# ICDGM
An R Package for Working with the German Modification of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems

The ICD-10 classification of diseases and related health problems (ICD-10) is an international standard for the coding of health service data. In Germany the [German Instutite of Medical Documentation and Information (DIMDI)](https://www.dimdi.de/static/en/dimdi/index.htm) releases a German Modification (ICD-10-GM) of the classification that forms a compulsory part of all remuneration claims in the ambulatory and hospital sectors.

This package was created to facilitate the analysis of data coded using the ICD-10-GM. In particular, it has three aims:

1. To provide a convenient interface to the historized ICD-10 metadata
2. To facilitate the specification of ICD groups, utilising the ICD hierarchy
3. To enable the historization of ICD specifications by applying automatic code transitions and displaying problematic codes

The package was created primarily for personal use but is under active development and has been used in several scientific papers.

## Basic Use

### Access ICD-10-GM metadata 

### Expand a ICD specification down the hierarchy

### Historise an ICD specification


## Copyright

The underlying ICD-10-GM metadata is copyright of the [German Instutite of Medical Documentation and Information (DIMDI)](https://www.dimdi.de/static/en/dimdi/index.htm). The underlying files are available free of charge from the [DIMDI Download Centre](http://www.dimdi.de/dynamic/de/klassi/downloadcenter/). I believe that their use in this package is compatible with the copyright restrictions.

## Related Packages

The [icd package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/icd/) on CRAN has similar aims but has a slightly different approach and focusses on the US version of the ICD-10 system.
